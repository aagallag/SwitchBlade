# SwitchBlade

Instantly loads up Horizon with homebrew enabled for all Switches (< 5.1.0) with all the other functions of Hekate removed. It is recommended to only use this for development, anyone else should wait for Atmosphere.

* Starting the payload while holding Vol+ will power off the device.
* Starting the payload while holding Vol- will start Horizon without homebrew enabled.
* Starting it normally will start Horizon with homebrew enabled.

## switchblade.ini File

* The `[stock]` section is when you startup SwitchBlade holding down the Vol- buttons.
* The `[hen]` section is when you startup SwitchBlade without holding any buttons.
