# SwitchBlade

**DO NOT UPDATE FOR THIS!**

Instantly loads up Horizon with homebrew enabled for 1.x/2.x/4.x/5.x Switches with all the other functions of Hekate removed. It is recommended to only use this for development, anyone else should wait for Atmosphere.

* Starting the payload while holding Vol+ will power off the device.
* Starting the payload while holding Vol- will start Horizon without homebrew enabled.
* Starting it normally will start Horizon with homebrew enabled.
